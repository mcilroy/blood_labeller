bug:
    self.idx is not the index_in_array
check:
    is self.idx being properly set? 
    can my program handle filling out a dataset half way and then reloading?
    when you save you use the idx to find the current entry, and idx = 1 more than it should
    if you are at the last one it wont increase idx so it is the right number
    solution: is to save before checking for new values

questions:
    should the labeller allow people to label more than one cell?
