UI processing:
    file menu
        button: quit
        button: load dataset

    label: "Label cell program"
    label: "Follow the prompts. You can quit at any time. The images are saved automatically when you move to the next cell.

    color image of the cell

    label: "Step 1: Mark damaged image or leave blank"
    4 checkboxes: part of image cutoff, more than two cells, no cell, marks or obstructions across image from process

    label: "Step 2: Select type of cell"
    buttons to select the type
    7 Neutrophil, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, Eosinophil, Basophil, Unsure, no cell

    Back button to go to previous cell

UI end screen:
    file menu:
        button: quit
        button: load dataset
    label: all done, load a new file if you wish to continue. Thanks!"
    back button

scenarios:
    human hits back button
        erase previous labels at index-1 in database, set index to index-1
        initialize blank UI, display the previous image at index
    load first dataset
        load dataset:
            create database if not exists otherwise use existing database
            if database contains filename
                get all data that has not been processed
                if processed_data == 0
                    go to end screen with message "already labeled. if your positive that this has not been labeled before, rename the file and try again"
                else:
                    display first result
                    wait for human to process
            else:
                open image numpy array
                create entries in database based on the index position of each image in the numpy array
                display first result
                wait for human to process

    human hits a cell button:
        get values of UI
        enter into database at index, mark entry as processed
        load new entry into UI at index+1
        if no more remaining then display end screen
        
            

database:
    primary_key(file_name, index_in_array), type, cutoff, more_than_one, nocell, obstructions, processed
